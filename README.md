# Omni-Grabber (WIP)

Small prototype to attempt to mimic an ufo catcher behaviour.

The player can move te claw with the jump button of the gamepad, first it will move left/right, then backwards/forwards, if it hits the set limits the claw will stop.

After moving the claw forward/backwards the claw will open, go down and close, if the claw comes into contact with any foreign object when going down the claw will stop and close.

Finally the claw will move back to the original position.
